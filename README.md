"I have created an AI chatbot using PySide6 in conjunction with Ollama, utilizing the DeepSeek R1:8B model for the AI chatbot.

It has many features, the most important of which is the chat saving feature. The .json log must be saved in the save_chats folder in order to view the chat history. I emphasize that the features include a login system (no registration system), chat saving, theme color adjustment, chat history deletion, and more. 

The accessible credentials are: 
user1: Admin, pass: 123456; 
user2: Goku, pass: 2548; 
user3: stu67, pass: 1234, 
etc. Enjoy chatting with the chatbot!"
